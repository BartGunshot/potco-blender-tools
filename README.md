# POTCO Blender Tools
This is a Blender addon which provides a number of tools for working with POTCO files in blender. Tested with 2.8, will probably work with 2.79.

## POTCO WorldData Importer
This addon adds in a rudimentary worldData importer for POTCO worldData files. These files store the placements of props, scenery, etc. on the various world spaces of POTCO. 

*File > Import > POTCO WorldData (.py)*

The worldData files are found in any src rip of POTCO. I recommend this one for this instance:
